# WP_Comicpress_Child_Theme
A child theme I created from the Comicpress theme for Wordpress (used with the Comic Easel plugin). I though I might try and create this in case I get asked to create a webcomic site (and possibly the the owner's miscellaneous notes).

Original: https://github.com/Frumph/comicpress

Comicpress is the property of it's owner, and is not mine. This is just a child theme I have created.
